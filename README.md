## About 

    A user input README generator that writes a README.md file for the user and fills the information based on user input of questions. The README file includes the project title, a description, a table of contents, an install guide, usage, a licence, contributions, tests, and user information and questions.

## Story

    As a user, I found writing out my README.md files to be a practice in patience, markdown, and syntax. Now, as I have evolved as a programmer, I would like to cut down the time I spend formatting my README.md files and focus more on the quality of the content. Here, I have used Node and Inquirer to develop a markdown format that generates a README file after answering a series of questions.
